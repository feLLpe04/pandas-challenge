ANALYSIS 

For Bottom Schools: Here the average math and the reading score really had a difference, with 5% difference, for math score 76.8 and average reading 80.74%, and passing students for each area really low as 66.4 for math and reading making a difference with 81%, what is really to improve is the overall passing with 52.9%, so we are taking by grant that the half looses theses competences. 

For Top Schools: The average Reading and average math Score are almost identical in each year 83.50%, however the passing reading is 3% highest as average and the overall passing % total 90%, just fluctuate between 0.5% to 1% total 90.90% average. Really steady historical.  

the school type District has weight more students, however, in quality of education the district offers a better money investment by student than Charters schools, we are talking about 12% more investment. 

another analysis is that the top schools with better grades are only charter type and bottom schools are always district, therefore, the result of the student budget per alumni is not related to alumni performance. Same time bottom schools are getting better resources by student by almost 15%, this represent to me the bad management that district schools have at the time to educate students with more money than charts throwing terrible results, something from the district schools need to change! # pandas-challenge
